Built-In Types for Data Representation
1. None
    The None type denotes a null object (an object with no value). Python provides exactly
    one null object, which is written as None in a program.This object is returned by func-
    tions that don’t explicitly return a value. None is frequently used as the default value of
    optional arguments, so that the function can detect whether the caller has actually
    passed a value for that argument. None has no attributes and evaluates to False in
    Boolean expressions.

2. Numbers
    Except for Booleans, all numeric objects are signed. All numeric types are immutable.
    1. Boolean ( True or False )
        Booleans are represented by two values: True and False.
        The names True and False are respectively mapped to the numerical values of 1 and 0.

    2. Integers:
        Integers represent whole numbers in the range of –2147483648 to 2147483647.
        (the range may be larger on some machines).

    3. Long:
        Long integers represent whole numbers of unlimited range (limited only by available memory).

    4. Floating point
        Floating-point numbers are represented using the native double-precision (64-bit) representation of
        floating-point numbers on the machine. Normally this is IEEE 754, which provides approximately 17 digits of
        precision and an exponent in the range of  –308 to 308. This is the same as the double type in C.
        Python doesn’t support 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers.
        If precise control over the space and precision of numbers is an issue in your program

    5. Complex number
        Complex numbers are represented as a pair of floating-point numbers.
        The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z are available in z.real and z.imag.
        The method z.conjugate() calculates the complex conjugate of z (the conjugate of a+bj is a-bj ).
